Progress: focusing on js w/o raphael

Now: 

-make draggable update location
-draggable containment problem



Then, go to user.rb
-role - project manager, architect, or systems engineer
-make 'create task' like create user
	-stage and factor = fixed, hard-coded

Questions for Jeff:
How do you test api_controller, that createtask stuff?
tested locally by putting url on own computer's browser

find bookmarklet debugger

handler = listener

Questions for later (probably trivial):
Is createuser (register) only for certain users, so you can't register straight-up?

Way Later:
Soft delete, which isn't an essential feature, isn't only partly done so far.
Key idea = The tasks table has a t.datetime "deleted_at" field
	-if this is null, the task is not deleted; 
	-if it's not null (it's an actual datetime), then that datetime is when the task was deleted, and the task is deleted.
