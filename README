*This branch has coffeescript incorporated into existing JS, and has started significant database changes.

See the "history of vds-pip" doc file for background on everything that's happened here.

Just done: dependency creation by dragging from side pane tree
made sure proper deps shown in folder/project.
allowed dependency deletion via documents/show popup

Now: dependency deletion between 2 folders depending on each other?

Old thoughts: 

Questions for later (probably trivial):
Is createuser (register) only for certain users, so you can't register straight-up?

Way Later:
Soft delete, which isn't an essential feature, is only partly done so far.
Key idea = The tasks table has a t.datetime "deleted_at" field
	-if this is null, the task is not deleted; 
	-if it's not null (it's an actual datetime), then that datetime is when the task was deleted, and the task is deleted.
