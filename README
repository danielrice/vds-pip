This branch has coffeescript incorporated into existing JS, and has started significant database changes.

Progress: focusing on js w/o raphael

Now:

Then, go to user.rb
-role - project manager, architect, or systems engineer
-make 'create task' like create user
	-stage and factor = fixed, hard-coded

Questions for Jeff:
How do you test api_controller, that createtask stuff?
tested locally by putting url on own computer's browser

find bookmarklet debugger

handler = listener

issues:

x and y coordinates of folder and docs should vary per user
	o new locations table, user id, x, y, folder_id and doc_id
	o people would be confused
	o purpose of dragging is for preference
	o composite primary keys more efficient, but harder to implement, than individual auto-incrementing primary keys
	o a folder has one location, a doc has one location, a user has many locations, a location belongs to [user, folder, doc]

document linked to user
	o whole point of version was to keep track of history of document
	o

Questions for later (probably trivial):
Is createuser (register) only for certain users, so you can't register straight-up?

Way Later:
Soft delete, which isn't an essential feature, isn't only partly done so far.
Key idea = The tasks table has a t.datetime "deleted_at" field
	-if this is null, the task is not deleted; 
	-if it's not null (it's an actual datetime), then that datetime is when the task was deleted, and the task is deleted.
