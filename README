Progress:

focusing on js w/o raphael

in testvdspip, I've found that the most simple drag functions of jquery and raphaeljs don't
work in vds. Stuck. maybe older or newer version of raphael?
maybe the drag problem is the "layer" in vds?

So I'll focus on something else for now -

Then, go to user.rb
-role - project manager, architect, or systems engineer
-make 'create task' like create user
	-stage and factor = fixed, hard-coded

Questions for Jeff:
How do you test api_controller, that createtask stuff?
tested locally by putting url on own computer's browser

find bookmarklet debugger

handler = listener

--

Questions for later (probably trivial):
Is createuser (register) only for certain users, so you can't register straight-up?

Way Later:
Soft delete, which isn't an essential feature, isn't only partly done so far.
Key idea = The tasks table has a t.datetime "deleted_at" field
	-if this is null, the task is not deleted; 
	-if it's not null (it's an actual datetime), then that datetime is when the task was deleted, and the task is deleted.
