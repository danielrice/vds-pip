*This branch has coffeescript incorporated into existing JS, and has started significant database changes.

See the "history of vds-pip" doc file for background on everything that's happened in this project.

Just done:
allowed dependency deletion via documents/show popup
disabled creating deps b/w folders
specific names for some stages, tasks, factors, auto folder creation on project creation
	added constant fields for stages, factors, tasks in config/application.rb

branch: locs-for-new-users: 
This branch has an incomplete attempt at figuring out why 
some user's get a null x and y coordinates for their folders/docs' locations.
I think it has to do with needing after_create in membership.rb for creating locations.
There is something rudimentary there now.
Also, I changed the order of creation for the top two - users created after projects, now.

Old thoughts: 

Questions for later (probably trivial):
Is createuser (register) only for certain users, so you can't register straight-up?

Way Later:
Soft delete, which isn't an essential feature, is only partly done so far.
Key idea = The tasks table has a t.datetime "deleted_at" field
	-if this is null, the task is not deleted; 
	-if it's not null (it's an actual datetime), then that datetime is when the task was deleted, and the task is deleted.
