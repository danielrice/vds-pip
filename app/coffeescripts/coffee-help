CoffeeScript is improved JS. http://coffeescript.org/
Files in app/coffeescripts are automatically compiled into JS in public/javascripts by Barista (gem).

Assumption: 
#container is the container that contains objects (folders, documents, etc.)

About the program design:
-the 'handle' is the white thing on folders that you can drag to draw dependencies

Quick coding advice: 
-In coffee, to call a function foo: -> (etc.) that is in this class from within another function, do @foo()
-Convention: _foo means foo() is a private method
-For a class's constructor, anything with a @ means it is accessible as a variable throughout that class.
  o kind of like an instance variable
-Methods in a class are defined like
	foo: (some, params) ->
		# code here
or, for no params,
	foo: ->
		# code here
In these cases, the foo methods are PROPERTIES of the class, meaning you can access them outside the class with classObj.foo()
Within the class, you would call @foo()

If you do
	foo = ->
		# code here
then foo is a not a property of the class - it's just a local function. Here, you just do foo() to call it.
In a sense, it's "private", although the _foo convention is used for methods in general. It really doesn't matter.
